abstract = {Both multi-band and space division multiplexing (SDM) independently represent cost-effective approaches for next-generation optical backbone networks, particularly as data exchange between core data centers reaches the petabit-per-second scale. This paper focuses on different strategies for implementing band and SDM elastic optical network (BSDM EON) technology and analyzes the total network capacity of three sizes of backbone metro-core networks: ultra-long-, long-, and medium-distance networks related to the United States, Japan, and Spain, respectively. Two BSDM strategies are considered, namely, multi-core fibers (MCFs) and BSDM based on standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) bundles of multi-fiber pairs (BuMFPs). For MCF-based BSDM, we evaluated the performance of four manufactured trench-assisted weakly coupled (TAWC) MCFs with 4, 7, 13, and 19 cores. Simulation results reveal that, in the regime of ultra-low (UL) loss and inter-core crosstalk (ICXT), MCF-based throughput can be up to 14\% higher than SSMF BuMFP-based BSDM when the core pitch exceeds 43\&\#x00A0;\&\#x00B5;m and the loss coefficient is lower than that of standard single-mode fibers. However, increasing the number of cores with (non-)standard cladding diameters, UL loss, and ICXT coefficient is not beneficial. As core counts increase up to 13 for non-standard cladding diameters (\&lt;230{\textmu}m), the core pitch and loss coefficient also increase, leading to degraded performance of MCF-based BSDM compared to SSMF BuMFP-based BSDM. The results indicate that, in scenarios with 19 MFPs, SSFM BuMFP-based BSDM outperforms 19-core MCF-based scenarios, increasing the throughput by 55\% to 73\%, from medium-backbone networks to ultra-long ones.},

abstract={Producing high-quality educational videos usually requires a large budget as it involves the use of expensive recording studios, the presence of a technician during the entire recording session and often post-production tasks. The high costs associated with video production represent a major hindrance for many educational institutions and, thus, many teachers regard high-quality video recording as inaccessible. As a remedy to this situation, this article presents SAGA (Autonomous Advanced Recording Studio in its Spanish acronym), a low-cost autonomous recording set that allows teachers to produce educational content in video format in an agile way and without the need for post-production. The article provides an overview of SAGA, including a description of its hardware and software so that anyone with basic technical knowledge can replicate and operate the system. SAGA has been used to record more than 1,500 videos including the contents of six MOOCs hosted on the MiriadaX platform, as well as four courses at UPM. SAGA has been evaluated in two ways: (1) from the video producers' perspective, it was evaluated with a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model, and (2) from the video consumers' perspective, a questionnaire was conducted among MOOC participants to assess the perceived technical quality of the videos recorded with SAGA. The results show a very positive general opinion of the SAGA system, the recorded videos and the technical features thereof. Thus, SAGA represents a good opportunity for all those educational institutions and teachers interested in producing high-quality educational videos at a low cost.},

The emergence of Learning Management Systems has made it possible to accurately pinpoint when procrastination takes place due to the unobtrusive collection of fine-grained data from students. However, most studies that analyze procrastination regard it as an intrinsic characteristic of students. In this work, we study procrastination as a process that unfolds with time. We use sequence analysis to map the evolution of students' procrastination behavior over a task-oriented programming course. Our findings evince that students' procrastination is not constant throughout a course and that students who tend to procrastinate are those who achieve worse academic performance.},

abstract = {The relentless demand for high-bandwidth services and applications in the beyond-5G/6G era necessitates optical networks to provide ample spectral resources to accommodate the increasing traffic loads. This requirement is especially pronounced in metro and regional segments, where a projected traffic compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40\%, driven by content delivery network (CDN) traffic concentrated near the end users, threatens to push the fiber capacity to its limits on a number of heavily utilized links in the short to medium term. This limitation cannot be circumvented despite the utilization of spectrally efficient modulation formats designed for short-distance transmission. Thus, it is imperative to explore migration strategies to solutions that allow the expansion of spectral resources beyond the current usage of the extended C-band (4.8\&\#x00A0;THz). In this article, we present a comprehensive evaluation of multi-homed edge-to-core routing, modulation-level selection, and spectrum assignment simulations conducted over reference metropolitan area networks (MANs) by leveraging on a novel network planner called 6D-MAN, which we have developed to adapt to heterogeneous multi-layer networks based on multi-band and multi-fiber transmission. Our simulations consider coherent transmission with flexible modulation format transponders operating at capacities ranging from 100 to 400\&\#x00A0;Gbps on the 50\&\#x00A0;GHz grid and explore link-by-link migration strategies restricted to the C$+$L-band, ensuring optimal performance in terms of the generalized signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR). The obtained results demonstrate that deploying L-band equipment on a selected number of links effectively extends the lifespan of existing networks, enabling congestion-free operation with minimal intervention. In their entirety, our findings underscore the importance of contemplating alternative spectral resources beyond the conventional C-band. They unequivocally accentuate the potential of L-band equipment strategic deployment to tackle capacity constraints in MANs, resulting in a 60\% reduction in fiber length and a remarkable 45\% decrease in new fiber-pair link deployment needs. The profound implications of efficient fiber capacity utilization manifest themselves in substantial OPEX and optical total cost of ownership savings, amounting to approximately 71\% and 17\%\&\#x2013;27\%, respectively, over a 10-year period. This research provides valuable insights for MAN operators seeking sustainable strategies to support the growing demands of future beyond-5G/6G services.},

  abstract = {As networks get more complex, the ability to track almost all the flows is becoming of paramount importance. This is because we can then detect transient events impacting only a subset of the traffic. Solutions for flow monitoring exist, but it is getting very difficult to produce accurate estimations for every <flowID,counter> tuple given the memory constraints of commodity programmable switches. Indeed, as networks grow in size, more flows have to be tracked, increasing the number of tuples to be recorded. At the same time, end-host virtualization requires more specific flowIDs, enlarging the memory cost for every single entry. Finally, the available memory resources have to be shared with other important functions as well (e.g., load balancing, forwarding, ACL).To address those issues, we present FlowLiDAR (Flow Lightweight Detection and Ranging), a new solution that is capable of tracking almost all the flows in the network while requiring only a modest amount of data plane memory which is not dependent on the size of flowIDs. We implemented the scheme in P4, tested it using real traffic from ISPs and compared it against four state-of-the-art solutions: FlowRadar, NZE, PR-sketch, and Elastic Sketch. While those can only reconstruct up to 60\% of the tuples, FlowLiDAR can track 98.7\% of them with the same amount of memory.},

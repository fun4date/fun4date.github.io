abstract={Producing high-quality educational videos usually requires a large budget as it involves the use of expensive recording studios, the presence of a technician during the entire recording session and often post-production tasks. The high costs associated with video production represent a major hindrance for many educational institutions and, thus, many teachers regard high-quality video recording as inaccessible. As a remedy to this situation, this article presents SAGA (Autonomous Advanced Recording Studio in its Spanish acronym), a low-cost autonomous recording set that allows teachers to produce educational content in video format in an agile way and without the need for post-production. The article provides an overview of SAGA, including a description of its hardware and software so that anyone with basic technical knowledge can replicate and operate the system. SAGA has been used to record more than 1,500 videos including the contents of six MOOCs hosted on the MiriadaX platform, as well as four courses at UPM. SAGA has been evaluated in two ways: (1) from the video producers' perspective, it was evaluated with a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model, and (2) from the video consumers' perspective, a questionnaire was conducted among MOOC participants to assess the perceived technical quality of the videos recorded with SAGA. The results show a very positive general opinion of the SAGA system, the recorded videos and the technical features thereof. Thus, SAGA represents a good opportunity for all those educational institutions and teachers interested in producing high-quality educational videos at a low cost.},

abstract = {Procrastination is one of the most common problems among students causing mental health issues, low motivation, and poor academic performance. The emergence of Learning Management Systems has made it possible to accurately pinpoint when procrastination takes place due to the unobtrusive collection of fine-grained data from students. However, most studies that analyze procrastination regard it as an intrinsic characteristic of students. In this work, we study procrastination as a process that unfolds with time. We use sequence analysis to map the evolution of students' procrastination behavior over a task-oriented programming course. Our findings evince that students' procrastination is not constant throughout a course and that students who tend to procrastinate are those who achieve worse academic performance.},

abstract = {The relentless demand for high-bandwidth services and applications in the beyond-5G/6G era necessitates optical networks to provide ample spectral resources to accommodate the increasing traffic loads. This requirement is especially pronounced in metro and regional segments, where a projected traffic compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40\%, driven by content delivery network (CDN) traffic concentrated near the end users, threatens to push the fiber capacity to its limits on a number of heavily utilized links in the short to medium term. This limitation cannot be circumvented despite the utilization of spectrally efficient modulation formats designed for short-distance transmission. Thus, it is imperative to explore migration strategies to solutions that allow the expansion of spectral resources beyond the current usage of the extended C-band (4.8\&\#x00A0;THz). In this article, we present a comprehensive evaluation of multi-homed edge-to-core routing, modulation-level selection, and spectrum assignment simulations conducted over reference metropolitan area networks (MANs) by leveraging on a novel network planner called 6D-MAN, which we have developed to adapt to heterogeneous multi-layer networks based on multi-band and multi-fiber transmission. Our simulations consider coherent transmission with flexible modulation format transponders operating at capacities ranging from 100 to 400\&\#x00A0;Gbps on the 50\&\#x00A0;GHz grid and explore link-by-link migration strategies restricted to the C$+$L-band, ensuring optimal performance in terms of the generalized signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR). The obtained results demonstrate that deploying L-band equipment on a selected number of links effectively extends the lifespan of existing networks, enabling congestion-free operation with minimal intervention. In their entirety, our findings underscore the importance of contemplating alternative spectral resources beyond the conventional C-band. They unequivocally accentuate the potential of L-band equipment strategic deployment to tackle capacity constraints in MANs, resulting in a 60\% reduction in fiber length and a remarkable 45\% decrease in new fiber-pair link deployment needs. The profound implications of efficient fiber capacity utilization manifest themselves in substantial OPEX and optical total cost of ownership savings, amounting to approximately 71\% and 17\%\&\#x2013;27\%, respectively, over a 10-year period. This research provides valuable insights for MAN operators seeking sustainable strategies to support the growing demands of future beyond-5G/6G services.},

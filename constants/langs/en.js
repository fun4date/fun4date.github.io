While in the past the average overall growth seen in the operators’ networks has been around 35%, this trend seems to keep increasing towards a 45% growth rate [Cisco2018]. Video streaming is still the dominating type of traffic nowadays, but other applications and services have appeared in the past years to stress networks even more, for example Machine-2-Machine (M2M) applications and Online Gaming, with 46% CAGR and 59% CAGR respectively. In parallel, mobile traffic (5G and Beyond-5G) is expected to play a key role in the use of telco infrastructure. Indeed, global mobile traffic is expected to grow twice as fast as IP traffic.",
